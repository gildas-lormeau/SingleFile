# Privacy Policy
Your data always belongs to you, and only you. SingleFile does not collect any data.

## How your data is protected and used
 - By default, SingleFile does not send any data to our servers or any third parties. All your data is processed and stored locally on your device. 
- If you connect SingleFile to your Google Drive account, data is only transmitted from your browser to servers belonging to Google. 
- If you enable the "synchronize options" setting, your options will be sent to servers belonging to the vendor of the browser you are using. 
- When processing a page, SingleFile needs to inject temporary data into the page to save it accurately. Also, when you save a page with SingleFile, it can download resources that are not displayed or not already cached but present in the page. Websites can also fetch resources declared in the "web_accessible_resources" section of the manifest.json file. Because of this, a website may be able to detect you are using or have saved a page on the website with SingleFile.
